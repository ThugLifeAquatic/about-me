  <article class="about">
    <p>My name is Austin Cohrs. I'm 29 years old and was born and raised in Wichita, Kansas. After graduating highschool, I joined the U.S. Coast Guard, and became an Electronics Technician. During my 6 year enlistment in the Coast Guard, I lived in Washington,
      California, and Hawaii. I met my wife, Chelsea, while stationed in Hawaii. We were married last June on Oahu.</p>
    <p>Ever since I left the Coast Guard, I have been searching for a new career. I have tried many things, but none have intrigued me for more than a few months. About a year or so ago, I had an idea for an online business. I needed a wesite, but I had
      never made one, and I couldn't afford to have one made for me. I decided to try and learn to build one myself. The more I learned, the more I realized how much I like coding. I switched my major to computer science and have been coding ever since.
      My quest to learn more, faster, has brought me to Codefellows.</p>
    <p>After I finish my schooling at Codefellows, I intend to work as an entry level developer to get experience and further develop my skills. Eventually, I would like to have my own web development company dedicated to developing for start-ups and small
      businesses.</p>
    <p>I now live in Belltown with my wife, Chelsea, and our kitten, Princess Leia.</p>
